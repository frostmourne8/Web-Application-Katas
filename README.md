Web-Application-Katas
=====================

A sandbox for me to play around with new web application technologies. The current application was developed using Angular.js and the Battle.net community APIs. It is being continuously integrated using Jenkins which deploys any changes to a server running on Amazon EC2. The server is located here: http://joshwakefielddemos.com/webkatas and can be used to demo the application.
